# C-_Physics_Engine
Git Repo for the C++ physics engine project

## Getting Started
### Building the program
Use make to build
```bash
make
```
This puts executables in the `build/` directory.
Tests can similarly be built and run by issuing 
```bash make test``` from the project root.

### Generating unit test data
Unit tests can be built and run with
```bash
make test
```

Unit test coverage data, if needed, can be generated with
```bash
make coverage
```
This will place an `index.html` file in `build/reports`, which shows
overall code coverage.
